  <h2>The Miami Heat</h2>

  <p id="border"> My favorite basketball team is the Miami Heat because my favorite player of all time, Dwyane Wade, played for the team for years. He became such a legendary figure that Miami was, unofficially, renamed "Wade County." I liked Wade and the Heat because of how fast they play the game. Frankly, I also love the uniforms and the Miami weather (who doesn't?).
  Recently, my fandom has reached new heights with the Heat's recent draft pick, Tyler Herro. Herro plays with a ton of confidence and its extremely entertaining to watch. This year, they went to the finals even when everynoe doubted them. I hope they can make it back there next season to win a championship!
  See <a href="https://www.instagram.com/miamiheat/">the Miami Heat Instagram page</a> to get a sense of the current team. </p>

  <h3> Everton </h3>
  <p> Everton is my favorite team in the English premier league. Everton hails from Liverpool and usually, honestly, they're 2nd in town to Liverpool. However, that isn't as certain right now since Everton has acquired the Columbian superstar, James Rodriguez. As of right now, they're 1st in the premier league.
