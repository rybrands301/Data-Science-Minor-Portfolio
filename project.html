  <p> Instead of looking at things more concretely in terms of what job I'll have, where I'll live, or what I might have, I decided to look more inward to explore who I want to be in 5 years and beyond. For me, I think that the above TED Talk -- "What Makes a Good Life? Lessons from the Longest Study on Happiness" -- provides closure to my exploration and answers the question: Who do you want to be in life? </p>
  <p>The video features psychiatrist Robert Waldinger, the 4th director of Harvard's study on happiness, the longest of its kind. The study aims to figure out what truly makes people happy and how happiness can positively impact our physical and mental wellbeing. The study has closely followed 2 groups of men -- Harvard graduates and residents of Boston's poorest neighborhoods -- for decades to get to the bottom of what drives happiness. The study found that it was solid, meaningful relationships, not fame or money, that were what truly made someone happy. Close relationships with others not only led to a happy life, but it also led to greater mental and physical health. For example, people were able to retain their memory longer depending on how happy they were! Keeping this study in mind will be advantageous for me as I carve out a life for myself in the next 5 years. As I move on from W&L and graduate in May, the coming years will be stressful and it'll be easy to just focus on work instead of family or friends. However, for me to be truly happy, I need to maintain my close ties and be a relationship-builder. This will ultimately create and sustain my happiness, and that's what I want for myself over the next 5 years and beyond.</p>
  <p>In sum, at the end of the day, I want to be someone that's happy. Not just becuase it can improve mental and physical health, but because it will allow me to draw greater meaning from the short time I'm alive. If I'll only be around for a limited time, why not get the most out of it? </p>

  <p> Professor Barry, thank you so much for a great semester. Learning the basics of web programming has been quite fun (I've discovered I like to code), and I think the skills I learned in this class will propel me towards future success. Have a good winter break!
